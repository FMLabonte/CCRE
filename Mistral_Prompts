Comparison prompt:
i have the following task for you i have a tsv with two collumns that contain "{category}" labels. i want you to create a third column named match in which you denot if the two collumns describe the same "{category}" the problem is that the original might have different formating or use 2 different names to describe the same "{category}".
use the labels yes and no to indicate if the two collumns describe the same "{category}".A partial match between collumns where multiple entries are listed and only one matches between them is also considered a match, if one is empty and the other isnt its not a match, if both are emtpty it is a match.. This problem can not be solved with programming and needs a human annotatotor or an LLM annotator so you need to to it yourself. Make sure to list and anotate all the entries present in the given TSV.
Return it as a json object that contains the TSV {{"Table":TSV}}.

Instructions for Filling the Table
Below are the guidelines for filling in the table. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy. Consider that it can happen that a text does not hold useful information in that case return NO information.
### Column Labels and Descriptions
#### Gene/Protein
Note the name of the gene/Protein for which connections to a disease or a treatment/chemical/medicine are described. Label it additionally with a (G) if it is stated to be the gene and (P) if it is a Protein. Otherwise, add none. Example: Protein(P)
add a (mut) label if the Gene or Protein is described to have a mutation. Example: Gene(G)(mut)
Add (fam) if for gene families instead of single genes. Example: Gene(G)(fam)
Add (path) if the pathway of the gene interaction is mentioned. Example: Gene(G)(path)
Only include Genes that are connected to a Disease consider the broader context of the text.
#### Disease
If a disease is connected to a gene, specify the disease here. If the disease is a cancer use the following format disease(cancer name)(cancer type). Enter (NA) if a category is not given. Use the information in the text and your understanding of cancer to fill in this information. We only care about genes that are connected to a disease.
For cancer types use the labels: Carcinoma, Sarcoma, Lymphoma, Leukemia, Myeloma.
Example: Cancer(lung cancer)(carcinoma) or parkinson
#### Treatment/Exposure
If a treatment (drug/chemical/radiation/knock-out, etc.) is mentioned that was used and a connection to the gene is mentioned, write it here. Example: DAS, DADS
#### Connection Disease
Use "connected" if no specific interaction is described; there is just some relationship between the gene and the disease.
Use "key gene" if the gene is directly described as a key gene or it is very clear that this particular gene plays a key role in the interaction.
Use “marker” if something is used as a marker gene.
Use “driver” if the gene/protein makes the disease worse
Use “suppressor” if the gene/protein counteracts (aspects of) the disease
#### Connection Treatment
Use "connected" if no specific interaction is described; there is just some relationship between the gene/protein and the treatment.
Use "target" if a treatment specifically targets this gene/protein.
Use “activator/suppressor” if the treatment activates/suppresses the gene/protein. Add (ind) if the connection is indirect. Example: activator(ind)
#### Disease Mechanism
Describe the mechanism to which the connection between the gene and the disease is tied. Use keywords, not full sentences. Examples include risk factor, better outcomes, proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, pro inflammation, anti inflammation
#### Treatment Mechanism
Describe the mechanism to which the connection between the gene and the treatment is tied. Use keywords, not full sentences. Examples include risk factor, susceptibility, resistance, better outcomes, growth inhibition, autophagy
#### Associated Factors
Enter information about other contexts or more specific info that don’t fit into the other categories. Examples include age, mechanisms of action etc.
#### Cellline
Specify the cell line mentioned in which the connection between the gene and other entities is described. If the exact cell line is not mentioned, add more general info like patient, human cancer cells, mouse cancer cells etc.
#### Species
Specify the species being studied (e.g., human, mouse, rat, etc.).
#### Tissue
Specify the tissue in which the connection was observed. If only the organ is stated, note the organ. If not specified, write NA.
If the paper talks about metastases, write metastases. If the organ of the metastases is known, note only the organ.
#### Confidence
Use the labels: low, medium, high.
Low: No source/experimental data, low certainty language.
Medium: Source/experimental data but uncertain language or certain language but no source.
High: Source/experimental data and high certainty language.
#### Type of Evidence
Use the following labels (direct, indirect, citation). Explanations:
Direct: if we have In Vivo or In Vitro evidence of a direct cause and effect.
Indirect: data strongly suggests a connection. a Correlation can be observed but not directly proven.
Citation: Given a citation in a text that does not specify the type of evidence. Formulations like: studies have shown or just a statement and a citation number behind it.
#### Sentence
Each sentence has a number given like this: Sentence[1]:. Provide the sentence numbers that support the statements made in the rest of the row. This often includes multiple sentences.
